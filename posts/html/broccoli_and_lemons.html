    <h1 class="title">Broccoli and Lemons</h1>

  <p>Today I made Jess Elliot Dennison’s Broccoli, Parmesan and Lemon
    Orecchiette pasta for the third time. Two portions of this dish contains
    an entire head of broccoli, which is an insane quantity of broccoli to
    eat in a single setting: more than I would usually eat in a week!</p>
  <p>It’s from <a href="https://www.elliottsedinburgh.com/shop/p/midweek-recipes-book-tmaah">her
      Midweek Recipe’s book</a>, which I can’t recommend enough. The recipes
    it contains are simple, bold and innovative, drawing from a simple set
    of ingredients that I find easy to keep a stock of, so no traipsing to
    obscure delis in the rain at 7pm in search of rare spices I can’t
    pronounce.</p>
  <p>I received the book as a Christmas present from my partner and have
    been cooking things from it at least once a week since then, usually
    more often. We’ve both been impressed with all the recipes so far,
    including but not limited to: miso flatbreads (only 3 ingredients,
    ridiculously easy and delicious); cavolo nero pasta (so dark and
    mysterious); and green lentils topped with torn burrata and a salsa
    verde so tasty that I genuinely struggle not to eat it all in one go
    with a spoon.</p>
  <p>Each recipe has given me a new appreciation for certain ingredients
    that I either hadn’t used before or had been neglecting with my
    ignorance until then. For example, <strong>lemons</strong> crop up in
    the large majority of the book’s savoury recipes, to the point where I
    was finding it ridiculous on my first skim read: how good can sour,
    seed-filled lemons really be? Surely not so good that you’d put them in
    basically <em>all</em> of your food? Little did smug past-me know how
    much life a sprinkle of zest and a splash of lemon juice can bring to a
    dish! After trying a variety of Jess’ recipes, my passion for lemons has
    now escalated to the point where I have now purchased a microplane
    specifically to maximise my per-lemon zest yield and I get nervous if I
    have fewer than 4 lemons in the house.</p>

  <p>Another example of an ingredient that this book has converted me on
    is broccoli. Under normal circumstances, if you were to ask me if I
    wanted to an entire head of broccoli for dinner, regardless of what it
    was accompanied with, I would likely politely decline and make subtle
    but concerned inquiries as to your mental health. However, after a few
    attempts at her broccoli pasta dish, Ms Dennison has me converted into a
    full-blown broccoli bandit boiling multiple heads of the green stuff
    into saucy submission on a rainy Sunday night!</p>
  <p>In summary: Midweek Recipes is a great book and I’m looking forward
    to unleashing the potential of other underappreciated ingredients that
    are currently languishing in our kitchen 🥦</p>
