title: Brocoli and Lemons
---

Today I made Jess Elliot Dennison's Brocoli, Parmsean and Lemon Orrechietti pasta for the third time. Two portions contains an entire head of brocoli, which is an insane quantity of brocoli to eat in a single setting. It's from [her Midweek Recipe's book](https://www.elliottsedinburgh.com/shop/p/midweek-recipes-book-tmaah), which I can't recommend enough! The recipes it contains are simple, bold and innovative, drawing from a simple set of ingredients that I find easy to keep a stock of, so no traipsing to obscure delis in the rain at 7pm in search of rare spices I can't pronounce.

I received the book as a Christmas present from my partner and have been cooking things from it at least once a week since then, usually more often. We've both been impressed with all the recipes so far, including but not limited to: miso flatbreads (only 3 ingredients, ridiculously easy and delicious); cavolo nero pasta (so dark and mysterious); and green lentils topped with torn buratta and a  salsa verde so tasty that I genuinely struggle not to eat it all in one go with a spoon.

Each recipe has given me a new appreciation for certain ingredients I either hadn't used before or had been underappreciating until then. For example, lemons crop up in the large majority of the savoury recipes, to the point where I was finding it ridiculous on my first skim read of the book: how good can sour, seed-filled lemons really be? Or at least so I thought until I started trying the recipes and realised how much life a sprinkle of zest and a splash of lemon juice can bring to a dish! My passion for lemons has now escalated to the point where I have now purchased a microplane specifically to maximise my per-lemon zest yield, and I get nervous if I have fewer than 4 lemons in the house.
